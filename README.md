# Projet : Algorithmes de recommandation basés sur le filtrage collaboratif 

This project focuses on re-implementing and evaluating algorithms for recommendation systems, specifically using collaborative filtering approaches. It explores the theoretical and practical aspects of recommendation techniques applied to datasets like MovieLens and Jester. The key objectives were to model user-item interactions and predict preferences using various algorithms.
